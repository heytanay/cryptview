The provided code is a GUI application is made in python and is made in PyCharm IDE that asks the user for a username and password. It utilizes the Tkinter library for creating the graphical user interface. The application follows the following workflow:

1. The user is prompted to enter a username and password.
2. If it is the first time logging in (default password is "Default"), the user is asked to set a new password.
3. If the entered username and password are valid, a welcome window is displayed.
4. The welcome window shows a PDF file that has the same name as the username. The PDF is displayed using the PyPDF2 library.

Libraries used in the code:
- Tkinter: A standard GUI toolkit for Python.
- PyPDF2: A library for reading and manipulating PDF files.

The code provides a basic structure for the described functionality. 
However, there might be some issues related to the specific versions of the libraries used, as there have been 
deprecations and changes in the PyPDF2 library. It's recommended to update the code and use PdfReader instead of PdfFileReader to avoid any deprecation-related issues.


INSTALLATION AND PRE-REQUISITES
PyPDF2==1.26.0
